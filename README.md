## Introduction

In this project, we want to explore the data of US women who got _bachelors degree_. The dataset contains years from 1970 to 2011 and 17 distinct majors. Here is the link for the dataset:[ us-wome-bachelors](https://www.kaggle.com/sureshsrinivas/bachelorsdegreewomenusa).

People can look at the trend for each major in recent years and compare the popularity of each major in specific year. In order to figure out the trend of women who got bachelors' degree in STEM major, we divided the 17 majors into 2 parts. One is STEM major, another one is non-STEM major. In our fourth and fifth page, people can compare 2 different years to see the popularity of STEM major (specific) and popularity of STEM and non-STEM major in general trend.

## Overview
Our interactive web app was created using US women’s bachelor degree data. This data is released by the Department of Education Statistics and we accessed it through kaggle.com. In the different tabs the user is allowed to choose a major they want to see, look at data from certain years, compare stem and non-stem degrees by year, and to explore the stem category. By having these features, prospective young college women have the ability to see trends in degree programs for women and to see the growing popularity of the stem department. We hope to help young women educate themselves on the growing demand for women in stem.
