## Overview
Our interactive web app was created using US women’s bachelor degree data. This data is released by the Department of Education Statistics and we accessed it through kaggle.com. In the different tabs the user is allowed to choose a major they want to see, look at data from certain years, compare stem and non-stem degrees by year, and to explore the stem category. By having these features, prospective young college women have the ability to see trends in degree programs for women and to see the growing popularity of the stem department. We hope to help young women educate themselves on the growing demand for women in stem.
